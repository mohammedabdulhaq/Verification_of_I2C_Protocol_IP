# Verification of I2C Protocol IP using SystemVerilog and UVM

## Overview
This document provides an overview of the verification process for the I2C Protocol IP using SystemVerilog and UVM methodology. The verification aims to ensure the IP core's functionality, compliance, and reliability.

## Verification Flow

### 1. IP Core Development
- Develop the I2C Protocol IP core in SystemVerilog.

### 2. Functional Verification
- Create SystemVerilog testbenches using UVM for functional verification.
- Write test cases to verify the basic functionality of the IP core, including data transmission and reception.
- Verify that the IP core correctly handles start and stop conditions.

### 3. Timing Analysis
- Verify that the IP core meets required timing constraints.
- Ensure reliable data transfer.

### 4. Protocol Conformance
- Verify that the IP core follows the I2C protocol rules.
- Check for correct data frame formats, acknowledgment signals, and error handling.

### 5. Error Handling
- Create test scenarios to validate the IP core's response to error conditions.
- Test bus contention, arbitration, and NACK handling.
- More to come

### 6. Regression Testing
- Continuously perform regression testing as the IP core is developed or modified.
- Ensure that new changes do not introduce regressions in previously verified functionality.
